INVENTORY ITEM TYPES - CRITICAL DISTINCTION:

The system must support TWO types of inventory items:

TYPE 1: BULK/DIVISIBLE ITEMS (can be sold partially by weight/volume)
Examples: 
- Dairy meal in large bags (70kg bag, sell by kg)
- Sugar in sacks (sell by kg)
- Flour in bags (sell by kg)
- Cooking oil in large containers (sell by liters)
- Any item where you sell portions of a larger container

Characteristics:
- Have a total quantity in the container (e.g., 70kg bag, 20L jerrycan)
- Can be sold in any amount (1kg, 3.5kg, 2L, etc.)
- Inventory decreases by the exact weight/volume sold
- Track remaining quantity precisely (decimal values like 45.7kg)
- Mark these as "Bulk/Divisible" in product setup

TYPE 2: UNIT/INDIVISIBLE ITEMS (sold only as complete units)
Examples:
- Medicine in cartons/boxes (sell whole cartons only)
- Bottled drinks (sell whole bottles only)
- Canned goods (sell whole cans only)
- Sachets/packets (sell whole sachets only, never half a sachet)
- Boxes of anything (sell whole boxes)
- Individual items like phones, tools, etc.

Characteristics:
- Counted in whole units only (1, 2, 3... never 1.5)
- Cannot be sold partially - must sell complete unit
- Inventory decreases by whole numbers only
- Track as integer quantities
- Mark these as "Unit/Countable" in product setup

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. When creating/editing a product, add a required field "Item Type":
   - "Bulk/Divisible" → enables weight/volume-based selling
   - "Unit/Countable" → only whole unit quantities allowed

2. In POS screen:
   - BULK items: show bulk sale option with weight/price calculator
   - UNIT items: only show quantity selector for whole numbers - NO bulk option

3. Inventory tracking:
   - BULK items: allow decimal quantities (62.5kg remaining)
   - UNIT items: whole numbers only (28 bottles remaining)

4. Prevent errors:
   - Don't allow bulk selling for unit items (can't sell 0.5 sachets)
   - Don't allow fractional inventory for unit items

This ensures each product type is handled correctly based on its nature.
